- Researched and Deployed a segmentation API with FASTAPI, achieving <span style="color:red">~37%</span> accuracy in model integration.
- Deployed API detecting depth map <span style="color:red">anomalies</span> using CREStereo-generated groundtruth and OpenCV.
- Contributed to <span style="color:red">data labelling</span>, and designing essential templates in Label Studio.

  better than pursuing high accuracy alone.
