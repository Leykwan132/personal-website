Making github profile cool..? Is that even a thing? Yes!

Let me show you how different you github profile could look like!

### **Before**

It look completely fine isnt it? But you could actually make it look better!

### **After**

I bet you're wondering how I did it. Let me show you how! It took less than 5 minutes to do it!

### **Step 1: Create the special profile readme**

Create a new repository with the same name as your username. For example, my username is `kkl`, so I created a new repository called `kkl`.

_Make sure to make it public & create a README.md file!_

### **Step 2: Start Designing your readme!**

Below are some of the cool stuff you could add to your readme:

### **Implementation**

Implementing them is as easy as replacing the API endpoint with your **username**!

```python
[![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=YourUserName)](https://git.io/streak-stats)
```

Yes, it's that easy!
