Yes people! I just revamped my personal website with <span style="color:red">Astro JS</span> ! I'm so excited to share this with you all. I've been working on this for a while now and I'm so happy to finally share it with you all!

### My first personal website
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56620672/150448681-6b24401f-0bcf-4c50-8861-55a9afa7e3e1.png" alt="drawing" width="400px"/>

Some part of it was pretty cool ngl. But I'm not hosting it anymore. You can still check it out [here](https://github.com/Leykwan132/personal-web).


### Why revamp the personal website?

My previous personal website was <span style="color:red">dead</span> few years back, literally.

Recently, I came across some super cool websites and I was like, "I want to make something like this too!" So I started working on it.

_Some really cool websites: [Jxian.Dev](https://jxian.dev/), [Codenanshu](https://codenanshu.in/)_


### Did I code it from scratch?

The short answer is no. I did not have a good sense of design. Full credits goes.

I did some **cool** changes to the original and will be sharing it in the future!

### So... What's next?

The main reason for me to revamp my personal website is to start blogging.

I enjoy exploring new things and I can't wait to share my learnings with you all!

I strongly believe that <span style="color:red">sharing is one of the best ways to learn</span>. I hope you will learn something from my blog posts too!
